What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

First The number must be divisible by the prime numbers so we start with  {1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}.
This number is also already divisible by all the composite numbers that use two primes i.e 6,10,14,15
We are left with 4,8,9,10,12,16,18,20 which are number is not divisible by.
adding 4, that takes care of, 8,12,20
adding another 3, we now have 9,18
all that is left is 16 which we can get by adding another 4.

Overall thats, 1*2*2*3*3*4*5*7*9*11*13*17*19= 232,792,560â€¬
