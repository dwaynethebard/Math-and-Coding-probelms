Problem </br>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. </br>
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. lets generilze this to and number N and any two numbers.

Solution:
The sum of all the multiples of 3 can be written as ![3+6+9+...+99=3(1+2+3+...+33)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3%2B6%2B9%2B...%2B99%3D3(1%2B2%2B3%2B...%2B33))
