Problem </br>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. </br>
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. lets generilze this to and number N and any two numbers.

Solution:
The sum of all the multiples of 3 can be written as </br>
![3+6+9+...+99=3(1+2+3+...+33)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3%2B6%2B9%2B...%2B99%3D3(1%2B2%2B3%2B...%2B33))
Where the sum of consecutive integers can be written as </br>
![1+2+3+\cdot \cdot \cdot + N = \dfrac{N(N+1)}{2}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%2B2%2B3%2B%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccdot%20%2B%20N%20%3D%20%5Cdfrac%7BN(N%2B1)%7D%7B2%7D)
